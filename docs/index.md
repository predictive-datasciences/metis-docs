## 🎯 Platform Overview

Metis is built around three core architectural spaces:

- **🎯 Core App Space**: Plugin-based client-specific functionality
- **🧠 ML Space**: Machine learning models and data processing
- **⚙️ Infrastructure**: Shared utilities and infrastructure components

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Understand the Architecture**: Start with [Introduction to Metis](architecture-overview.md)
2. **Learn Data Flow**: Review [Data Flow](architecture-part-1.md) patterns
3. **Follow Coding Standards**: Check [Go Guidelines](go-guidelines.md) and [Python Guidelines](python-guidelines.md)
4. **Set Up Development**: Follow [Repository Structure](repo-structure.md) guidelines

## 📚 Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized to support both **developers** and **architects**:

- **Architecture docs** provide system design and technical decisions
- **Coding guidelines** ensure consistent development practices
- **Operations docs** cover monitoring, logging, and maintenance
